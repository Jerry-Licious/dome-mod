# Dome Visualised

Displays all possible moves of all enemies while in combat when you have Runic Dome. Damage calculated in "real time".

## Usage

Some enemies have a gigantic list of moves. If you believe that the monster will use a specific move (or one of a selected few moves), you can click on the other moves to "toggle" them. This way, you can focus on the move that you believe the monster will use.

After a monster takes their turn, their last move will be coloured red.

Some monsters (louse and darklings to be specific) do not have a fixed base damage for some of their attacks. Their base damage is rolled at the start of each combat. Since the mod should not provide information that the player is not supposed to know, the range of possible damage will be shown instead.
